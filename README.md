## About

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

Originally developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley, vLLM has evolved into a community-driven project with contributions from both academia and industry.

If you use vLLM for your research, please cite their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180):

## Quick Start

> **Recommended:** Build from source. The prebuilt images on GHCR and Docker Hub lag behind `main` — custom kernel work (CuTe attention, stream-K GEMM) ships here first and images are only rebuilt periodically.

### Prebuilt image (convenience)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/navi-ai-lab/nvllm:latest
```

Also on Docker Hub: `docker.io/naviailab/nvllm:latest`

### Build from source (recommended)

**Required flags:** `--gpus all --ipc=host --network host` (vLLM needs shared memory and GPU access).

**Cache mounts** (recommended — avoid re-downloads and JIT recompilation on restart):

- `~/.cache/huggingface` — model weights
- `~/.cache/flashinfer` — FlashInfer JIT kernels
- `~/.cache/vllm_compile` → `/root/.cache/vllm/torch_compile_cache` — CUDA graph cache

**For gated models** (e.g., Gemma 4): pass `HF_TOKEN` via env or mount a credentials file.

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10) or GH200
- Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- Hugging Face account with model access
- `huggingface-cli` on host (`pip install huggingface-hub`)

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navi-AI-Lab/nvllm.git
cd nvllm
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.gb10 -t nvllm:gb10 .
```

Already cloned? Pull the latest first:

```bash
cd nvllm && git pull
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.gb10 -t nvllm:gb10 .
```

### 2. Serve a model

```bash
./scripts/serve.sh
```

First run downloads the model automatically (~18 GB).
API available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

All models are served as `default` — use `"model": "default"` in API calls:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "default", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```

### Serve Scripts

| Script | Model | Status | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `serve.sh` | [Qwen3.5-27B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/ig1/Qwen3.5-27B-NVFP4) | Active (default) | 64K |
| `serve-cute.sh` | [Qwen3.5-27B-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/ig1/Qwen3.5-27B-NVFP4) (CuTe Paged Attention; override `HF_MODEL` env) | Active (kernel dev) | 64K |
| `serve-nemotron.sh` | Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4 | Not Ready | 128K |
| `serve-gemma4.sh` | Gemma 4 31B IT NVFP4 | Degraded (see script) | 32K |

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--tq` | TurboQuant KV cache — more context capacity, ~25% lower throughput (serve.sh only) |
| `--debug` | Eager mode, no CUDA graphs (for debugging) |

### Roadmap

#### Now — Qwen3.5-27B kernel work

- CuTe DSL paged attention uber-kernel (fused attention + W_O GEMV + RMSNorm)
- `CUTE_WO_SPLIT={2,4,8}` opt-in K-parallel W_O GEMV. Default remains `1`; production soak keeps optimized splits opt-in after wo8 showed +3.3% wall improvement, -25.52 ms p95 TPOT, and GSM8K parity within 1/50. See the [production soak writeup](benchmarks/nvllm/traces/wo_split_prod_soak/2026-05-04-soak/writeup.md).
- CUDA graph support (FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode)
- End-to-end fusion validation through Qwen3NextAttention

#### Next — expand model support

- Gemma 4 31B IT — blocked on vLLM PR #38891 (per-layer attention backend for mixed head_dim)
- Devstral 2 Large — NVFP4 quantization and serve script

### SM120 Stream-K Decode Optimization

This fork includes a custom CUTLASS FP4 GEMM kernel with **stream-K scheduling** for small-M decode (M≤16). Stream-K distributes K-dimension work across SMs, improving utilization when the batch size is too small to fill all SMs with standard tile scheduling.

Based on CUTLASS's own `sm120_bs_gemm_nvf4_nvf4_f32_f32_stream_k` test kernel, adapted for vLLM's dispatch:

- **Tile:** 128×128×256 (K doubled from default 128)
- **Schedule:** `KernelTmaWarpSpecializedCooperative`
- **Tile scheduler:** `StreamKScheduler`

Benchmarked on Qwen3.5-27B-NVFP4 (rate=8, max-num-seqs=4):

| Metric | Baseline | Stream-K | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Output tok/s | 40.0 | 44.9 | **+12.2%** |
| TPOT p50 | 89.2 ms | 80.0 ms | **-10.2%** |
| TPOT p99 | 91.7 ms | 82.7 ms | **-9.8%** |

[Trace](benchmarks/nvllm/traces/gemm_stream_k_cudagraph/2026-04-21/) — committed `streamk_graphs.pt.trace.json.gz` + per-kernel CSVs.

> **Warning:** Large models (>75 GB) that leave minimal memory headroom on the GB10's 128 GB unified memory may crash during CUDA graph capture with the stream-K kernel. Use a smaller model to test first.

### CuTe Paged Attention Backend (Prototype)

Custom paged attention backend using CuTe Python DSL, targeting SM120/SM121 FP8 MMA instructions. Registered as `CUTE_PAGED` in vLLM's attention backend registry.

**Status:** Experimental CuTe DSL backend; production decode path since v0.3.0. The β-coop fused kernel (attention + W_O + RMSNorm + MLP) is the default. Opt-in `CUTE_WO_SPLIT=8` is production-evidenced but not the default: the controlled harness reports W_O `13754 μs → 1639 μs` (8.39×), while serving soak shows `wo8` as a modest wall/TPOT win with quality parity. See the [harness summary](benchmarks/nvllm/traces/cute_paged_attn/2026-05-03-w-o-k-parallel-harness/summary.md) and [production soak](benchmarks/nvllm/traces/wo_split_prod_soak/2026-05-04-soak/writeup.md).

Launch with: `./scripts/serve-cute.sh` (default PIECEWISE CUDA graphs). To opt into the evidenced W_O split, run `CUTE_WO_SPLIT=8 ./scripts/serve-cute.sh`.
